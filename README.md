# [Project 1: Finding patterns in spanish cities based on land use and spatial configuration. (https://github.com/cristianvergaraf/Location-factors-of-tree-plantation-expansion-)
* We used hierarchical clustering model to find group of cities based on land use, spatial congifuguration and
* Statistics model using logistic regression to assess relative importance of location factors in the expansion of forest plantations in south-central Chile.
* Relative importance of variables was performed using a multimodel inference approach in R.

# [Project 2: Finding patterns in spanish cities based on land use and spatial configuration. (https://github.com/cristianvergaraf/Location-factors-of-tree-plantation-expansion-)
* We used hierarchical clustering model to find group of cities based on land use, spatial congifuguration and
* Statistics model using logistic regression to assess relative importance of location factors in the expansion of forest plantations in south-central Chile.
* Relative importance of variables was performed using a multimodel inference approach in R.

* # [Project 3: Land use cover classification using landsat images for the lingue basin in south central Chile (https://github.com/cristianvergaraf/Location-factors-of-tree-plantation-expansion-)
* Download landsat images using google earth engine
* Classify land use cover applying machine learning algorthms as random forest, sopport vector machine, 

# [Project 4: Assessment of location factors of tree plantations in South-Central Chile](https://github.com/cristianvergaraf/Location-factors-of-tree-plantation-expansion-)
* Statistics model using logistic regression to assess relative importance of location factors in the expansion of forest plantations in south-central Chile.
* Relative importance of variables was performed using a multimodel inference approach in R.
